# ParzenWindow-PR_Experiment
Implement the parzenwindow, which is the experiment 1 in Pattern Recognition.(Harbin Institute of Technology, CS, Master). I've read a few ParzenWindow samples which realized by Pyhton, but none of them are correct, so I spend three days in understanding and programing it. Hope it'll help you:)
